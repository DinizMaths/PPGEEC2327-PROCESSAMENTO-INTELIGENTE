<!-- <div class="alert alert-block alert-info"><b>Tip: </b> Use blue boxes for Tips and notes. If it's a note, you don't have to include the word "Note". </div> 
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning"><b>Example: </b> Use yellow boxes for examples that are not inside code cells, or use for mathematical formulas if needed. </div>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-success"><b>Up to you: </b>Use green boxes sparingly, and only for some specific purpose that the other boxes can't cover. For example, if you have a lot of related content to link to, maybe you decide to use green boxes for related links from each section of a notebook. </div>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger"><b>Just don't: </b>In general, just avoid the red boxes. </div> -->
